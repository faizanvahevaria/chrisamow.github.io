rouge doesn't seem to be code highlighting correctly, the html seems ok...
these things don't work:
```
```python
~~~

the only thing that works (is the worst one!)
{% highlight python %}
    from scipy import ndimage as nd
{% endhighlight %}
actually i think this is not really working - i don't think rouge is acting on it, not that it was doing anything anyway
