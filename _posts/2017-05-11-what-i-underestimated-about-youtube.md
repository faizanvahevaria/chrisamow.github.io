how many people really want to teach and perform
  
there are many covers of this zedd song, and this isn't the fanciest but I really like it - I think it captures the spirit of the song - a dynamic emotional feel and layering.  it's a song that sounds way better on the piano than the guitar to me.  I didn't get the energy in the song until we saw him live (you should PLAY some anton - how many DJs are skilled at piano and drums) last year - the power of the drop.
  
maybe I need to learn songs like this to break me out of the newb key of C habit.
  
it was cool seeing sting sing this with mathew koma too
