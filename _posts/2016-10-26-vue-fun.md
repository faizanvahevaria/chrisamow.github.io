## remembering why i like vue.js

I like it not being actively owned by facebook or google.  

Even though Evan is ex-google, it is awesome seeing him able to independently get grass-roots funded and focus on vue.  I've heard they are beating react on performance at this point with the virtual DOM and version 1 was only out last fall I think.

The lean-ness level feels right, and the supporting ecosystem means you won't be unduly limited.  And being able to use the components should really help break front end problems down.

I'm comfortable with the way he articulates his vision and rationale:

Now that Vue2 is out, it feels like the momentum is good.  There's a clean slate for thinking about webdev.  If I focus on vue using restful services I can always switch away from flask to whatever - maybe even dotnet core - there are some good lightweight rest demos for it on linux now.
