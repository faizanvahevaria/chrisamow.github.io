Genetic universal iding...
  
I'm sure there is some consideration for this in AI, I'm just not immersed in the domain to know the terminology.

I think it's fascinating the difference between siblings in behavior and personality.  While some environmental factors are huge - deidentification, competition, younger/older sibling treatment and parental acknowledgement, apparently the gene randomness does quite a good job.  Is it nature's way of making the offspring as unique as possible for a more diverse survival of the fittest pool?  Is the analogy not useful because genetic algorithms brute force their way instead of giving us a sparse sampling?  It would be interesting to see how it could be modeled if the genetic algos parameter list was loosened up (so it was no longer practical to iterate through it all.)
