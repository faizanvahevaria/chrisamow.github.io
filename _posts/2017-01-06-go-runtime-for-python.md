A lot of people seem to think this will not be very beneficial to those outside of google.  Others are saying this is signaling the demise of python (shift to golang) - citing google's statement that only 2.7 is supported.
  
Barring that I hope it is an accessible tool, it will be nice essentially having the choice of getting performant python by using it with C libraries like numpy or the go runtime.
