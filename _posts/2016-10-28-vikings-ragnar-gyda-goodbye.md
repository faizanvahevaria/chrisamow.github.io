## The most moving scene I can remember 
  
watching on a show - there are some things so different in his world, but not long ago I was noticing some of the same things he saw in my nearly 12 year old daughter...  For someone who doesn't even have children Fimmel captured it so well, I can't imagine coming up with such perfect words - it is too horrible to comtemplate being in this situation.  -chris
