I hadn't given much thought as to how python's regular expression implementation compared with other languages.  Armin gives a pretty glowing review.
  
This is an interesting thing about parsing scanners he does here, but whenever a feature is hidden to me that screams "it might not be there at some point" (implementation detail dependence)
