(No, not rest api vs...)
  
Every time I think I'm getting convinced that they just can't match native apps, I get sucked back in!  I feel the need to track what m$ is doing with the xamarin stuff and from a different angle (cross platform with ios too) this React Native would be so nice and convenient, it can't be, can it?

[some comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11517705)
  
notes from the original article:  
* more evangelism than post mortem-ish
* "The API surface area of React Native is huge. It exposes most of the building blocks of iOS and Android apps to JavaScript, while adding cross-platform abstractions. It would be challenging for any single person to be closely familiar with all the APIs"  
* 107 apps created with it  
  
  
some comments that piqued my interest (some of the criticisms had a shelflife i'm sure):  
* gesture handling  
* live reload  
* permissions questionable - sms read, nfc, gps
* [try it out in the browser](https://rnplay.org/)
* no css
