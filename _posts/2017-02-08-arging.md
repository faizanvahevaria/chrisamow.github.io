I've been looking at these for a while  
<https://realpython.com/blog/python/comparing-python-command-line-parsing-libraries-argparse-docopt-click/>
  
argparse, docopt, click
  
but I never quite warmed up to them.
  
For some reason, I never saw easyargs before.  To me this feels so pythonic - it is amazing how people interpret that differently.
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/easyargs/0.9.3>
  
The types are inferred from the defaults and other properties like position are derived from naming convention - sweet!  And the generated help is not bad...
