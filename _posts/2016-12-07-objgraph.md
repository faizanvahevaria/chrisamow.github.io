This python tool looks very interesting.  And it is a good time to look at python leaks since I've been critical about javascript stuff including leaks...
  
It's also interesting to see how others approach unit testing.

It is another point for going to python3 - since it addresses [high water memory fragmentation](http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/python/python/1162114)   We seem to have some types of leaks that have lawyered up and defined themselves as nonleaks!
  
The [UMDH](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff560206(v=vs.85).aspx) tool by microsoft is a bonus!
