This python tool looks very interesting.  And it is a good time to look at python leaks since I've been critical about javascript stuff including leaks...  It is also a heads up on lxml which I use.
  
It's also interesting to see how others approach unit testing.

It is another point for going to python3 - since it addresses [high water memory fragmentation](http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/python/python/1162114)   We seem to have some types of leaks that have lawyered up and defined themselves as nonleaks!
  
The [UMDH](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff560206(v=vs.85).aspx) tool by microsoft is a bonus!
  
Nice job Ben!  The footnotes were pretty hilarious too...!
