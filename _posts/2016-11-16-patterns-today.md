Interestingly, my views are reflected in a scattering of of the opinions here...
  
<http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/335891/did-the-gang-of-four-thoroughly-explore-pattern-space>
  
gof patterns only were to compensate for language shortcomings - disagree
  
lack of critical mass - I think some of the patterns have critical mass, e.g. observer, inversion of control - but to expand into the pattern space?  yes, if you move beyond a handful you lose the power of having a simple common language
  
design patterns failed?  - I think only in that they weren't a panacea and never should have been looked at in that light
  
the opinions actually were pretty harsh on gof patterns - I bet most of them are just looking at current architectures instead in which many of the decisions have been made - often including some of these patterns
