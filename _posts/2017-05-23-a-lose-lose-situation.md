Apparently the mma guy thought he was exposing a scammer and ended up getting chased out of his fighting career.
  
Even if the Tai Chi guy won, would the mma community have accepted that, or would there be a huge line of fighters wanting to take the test - there would have been little counter incentive.  It is curious how out of touch he must have been - is it a story of the out of control ego or danger of the cult?  Even if it had been the gracies, very used to this challenge match world, they figure ten years or twenty pounds equivalent to a dan level, and they do not inflate that as much as many martial arts (typically is logarithmic experience vs rank.)
  
  
humans...!  lol
