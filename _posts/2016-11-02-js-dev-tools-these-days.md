I think this is still recent enough to capture the spirit of the environment.  Eric Elliott has a background I can identify with and a lot of these tools I have not used yet.  Maybe there is an impedence mismatch feeling for me between the tools for static compiled languages and the new dynamic interpreted languages.
  
While some of the tools feel like just the thing I wanted, for example js time travel debugging feels like a familiar solution since I have used backtracing in low level debugging tools like softice.  The offerings feel so fragmented and not conducive to mastery in one area - maybe it just echoes the web development ecosystem at large - I sometimes wish they would backfill and get rid of the many quirks instead.  I was blown away by how many scaffolding projects are on yeoman now!
  
Things are changing so fast, most of these tools arent that old, this article is a year old and I need to go look around and see what else is out there recently.  It is pretty exciting stuff...
