I am still on the fence about [python type hinting](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/python-3-type-hints-and-static-analysis--cms-25731)
  
While I do miss some of the creature comforts of having the computer work as hard as possible finding my mistakes (I'm amazed by the stuff that makes it past pyflakes) - this feels unpythonic to me. I don't like counting on optional features

I have to experiment some with polymorphic behavior - handling objects by their base class and see how it feels.  
  
I hope it's not just language entropy.  I wish they'd just find a way to fix the GIL...
