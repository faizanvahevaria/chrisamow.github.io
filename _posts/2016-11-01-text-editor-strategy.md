After having put this off far too long, I have DECIDED!  I try to keep the tool changes to a minimum, but I am starting to see a worst of both worlds situation evolvoing.  And I gave sublime a try, but I'm just not digging it.
  
vim config will be kept relatively lean (maybe just set up for python, html, and md - debating cpp) - quick install when I use other machines
  
neovim config will be the full polyglot setup (syntax highlighting and completion) - main dev machines
  
It would be nice to find some elegant way to share the most important bindings so they don't get out of sync.  Not sure if a simple source to a common file will be the best way.

  
  
I just hope it doesnt end up too ridiculous, accumulating nvim setup notes here, still going for fast setup I hope - minimal cloning and building.  Still hoping to keep the number of plugins small as well.  e.g. don't really want to use a plugin to fix the apostrophe issue in markdown
