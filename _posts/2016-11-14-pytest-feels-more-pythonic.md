not surprisingly, I like using [py.test](pytest.org) (import pytest) instead of the built-in PyUnit (import unittest) because it is simpler with less boilerplate but it is still powerful enough without total reliance on plugins (as some would say about nose)
  
some good py.test commandline options:

and the --pdb and --pudb modes are sweet!
  
it sure is very actively maintained...
