I never knew that using the numbers while playing youtube should let you jump around.
And it didn't surprise me that it doesn't work on linux/chrome.  Plot twist: shift-number DOES work.  It is pretty cool and it is something I will probably use a lot (5=50% through)
  
I don't see that documented or noticed by anyone anywhere...  The much talked about double tap skip 10 second thing on android is pretty nice also.
  
update: I noticed this only works on chrome 56, not 47 - not sure where the cutoff is
