I'd resigned to going with the flow on markdown - everyone seems to be using it, including github.  My past fights picking what I liked instead of what is popular included Replay (vs Tivo) and mercurial (vs git.)

But, I think Eric is right about his reservations...

So, maybe I will take a harder look at Sphinx.
