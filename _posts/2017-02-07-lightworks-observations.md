Not going to call this a review, but a list of issues I'm trying to work through:
  
- no OS title bar anymore? no menu at the top at all?

- graphics test - runs - but then where are the results?  strange

- no visual way to invoke undo?  need to guess ctrl-z?  how about a redo?

- how to see keymappings in general
