I'm simultaneously happy that others see what I've seen and sad that the net .net experience still isn't so great.  I was secretly hoping that there was a unicorn field I just hadn't found yet where vim could easily be loaded up with near-ide completeness easily.  But no.  I'm not sure I'd be so easily and willing to give up visual source debugging and going back to ye-olde printf debugging - but maybe that mindset is easier in backend development thinking.
