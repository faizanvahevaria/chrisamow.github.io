Sad that Turing isn't more widely recognized by non nerds as one of the Michael Jordans of tech thinking.  I'm glad that this guy on youtube didn't cop out on the dark ending to his story.  It makes you wonder if he was a savant, imagine walking around conjuring up leading edge math all the time.  I think it was interesting that he valued the physical aspect of life - or was running a coping mechanism.  Alas, he did burn out on cs - where was his path if the persecution didn't come along.  
  
I wonder if he always knew how he'd go out (apple.)
