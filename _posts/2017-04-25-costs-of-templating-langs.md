This was good food for thought.  As usual the comments from diverse developers were insightful.
  
I think the spirit of his complaint about templating (and he was quite open about vue being the inspiration for video) - that imperative capability is lost - is exaggerated.  It would have been nice to see better examples because in general, that kind of need is well addressed by computed properties and functions in vue.
  
If this video was the only exposure to the javascript framework scene I think you'd assume that react was way easier and more productive.  I don't this this necessarily bears out in the real world and some of the comments reflected that.  i.e. all else is not equal - if there was a pure js version of vue maybe I'd use that, or maybe vue render() is good enough, havent needed it yet.  The social cost aspect is similar - there is the overall cost of the framework to consider, not merely the part that directly renders, I do not think that one can reasonably say the learning curve of react overall is significantly easier than vue.  Looking at react for small projects and that is probably quite opposite.
