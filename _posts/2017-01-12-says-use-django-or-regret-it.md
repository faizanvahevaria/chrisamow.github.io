Some good points, have seen some of it.  Somewhat of a strawman argument (I think almost anyone would agree use the right tool for the job and neither are universally a solution.)  Plus I don't think he gave a fair shot at the case where django's opinionated framework doesn't work for you - which I recall many people having issues with (e.g. it is too tuned for the publishing domain)
