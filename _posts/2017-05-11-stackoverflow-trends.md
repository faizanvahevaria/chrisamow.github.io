Things going in a good direction...
  
python moving on up  
I'm surprised angular so strong vs react - anecdotally feels the other way around  
vue seems like the only small framework clearly moving up - surprising...  
flash and silverlight drifting down like that penny stock you shouldn't have bought  
r wow, pandas coming on strong too though, tensorflow coming up fast  
big data frameworks seem stagnant surprisingly
