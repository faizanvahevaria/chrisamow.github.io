{% include JB/setup %}
This looks pretty interesting - I love having the computer do the work and miss some of the helpfrom static tools of the past.  I'm not sure how awkward the type definition (libdef) files will be - I was hoping that javascript would be able to do more automatically with reflection - or maybe have a good view of things after the first run.  The inference stuff looks cool, hopefully it will be really useful and it won't require too many annotations.
  
I'm looking forward to playing around with it...
