I've been hearing more and more about electron this year and didn't realize how many apps are written in it...(I can't believe it is over 3 years old!)  It didn't occur to me that Visual Studio Code would be written in it!

It seems like vue / electron / firebase could be a pretty powerful combo.  Is there any point in fighting the nodejs borg?
  
Which brought me to this - low intensity exposure - by osmosis?
